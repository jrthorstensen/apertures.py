A program to replace some of the functionality of IRAF's apfind, apedit, and aptrace with pure-python code.

The program creates a description of the region on a 2-d CCD image of a spectrum that will later be used to extract 1-d spectra.   Not all the functionality of apfind (etc) is implemented, and the use cases are more limited, but should cover many common tasks.

The look-and-feel is rather similar to the IRAF tasks it replaces, with cursor-driven commands to define apertures, edit trace points and so on.  The exact commands are not the same.

The code works either with dispersion parallal to rows or to columns.  It has not been tested on severely tilted spectra.

The output is a database 'ap' file crafted to be in exactly the same format used by IRAF.
